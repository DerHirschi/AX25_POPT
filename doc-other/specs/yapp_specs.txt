Abort                            Send CN                   CW

--------
Starting States

For 2 users not using Remote Server

    Sender goes to State S, Receiver to State R after manually
    exchanging file names.  Since File Name is known, Recevier
    may optionally send RF from state R and bypass file header.
    Sender should give Receiver ample time to get into Receive
    State.

For Remote Server Mode

  USER (Start)                                       Next State

  User wishing to Send                               S
  User wishing to Receive          Send RI           R
  Other Server Request             Send COMMAND      Start

  SERVER (Start)

  Gets SI                                            R
  Gets RI             (file fnd)                     S
                      (no file)    Send NR           Start

  Gets COMMAND                    (Do Command)       Start

---------------------------------------------------------
All states except Send Data should timeout if nothing is heard
for a period of time Tc (Crash timer).  Send Data isn't expecting
any input and if it should receive some it must be a Cancel, or
a TX (text) packet, otherwise Abort.

--------
Revision 1.1 - Added AF & AT to acknowledge End of File and
End of Transfer.  This allows an automated sender to know that
a file was received successfully.  It also helps get past a
problem in the TNC-2 code by requiring the sender to wait for the
Ack-EOT before switching from transparent mode back to converse
mode.

RESUME
--------------

The new state introduced from FC1EBN in TPK are explained and is inserted in
state table for recieve and send a file.
Note that it's valid only if RESUME is true. This will implie or not
the cancellation of file in case of transfer abort.
This metode is ok for resume a file transfert but it have some limit if
the two station hasn't the same RESUME state ON or OFF or not!

1st example:
A is a sender with RESUME OFF and B is receiver with RESUME ON.
A initiate transfer with B and at certain time this will abort.
In this case B (RESUME ON) don't erase the file and retry to download from A.
Now the transfer always abort because B that already have a part of file
request the resume that A interpret as Abort.

2nd example:
A is a sender and B is receiver both with resume ON.
Today B download PINCO.ZIP (1st version, 10KByte) from A.
Tomorrow in A there is the same filename but with lenght changed due a
new version of program (PINCO.ZIP 2nd version, 11Kbyte).
If B never delete the previous version of PINCO.ZIP from download directory
the last 1000 byte of new file are append to the 10000 of the old one make
simply caos!!
This because Yapp never check if it is the same file (eg comparing filedate
and time).

YappC extension introduced in F6FBB BBS 5.14
--------------------------------------------

When a user request a resume of a previuos file transfer, every Yapp frame
long pklen byte is followed from a simple checksum byte.

So during a resume a Yapp Send_Data frame is:

STX len (Data) chksum

If len = 0 then data lenght = 256, note that len not include chksum byte and
this is the checksum of Data byte.

21/5/92

Extensions to the Yapp protocol used in TPK v 1.65a and FBB v 5.14
------------------------------------------------------------------

HEADER extension:
-----------------

The header now carry the DATE and TIME of the file being transmitted.

[SOH] [Len] [Filename] [NUL] [File Size] [NUL] [Date] [Time] [NUL]

Date and Time are the values reported by DOS, coded in 4 hexadecimal
characters and sent in ASCII.

Receiver has the choice to use extended Yapp with checksum or normal Yapp.

- Normal Yapp reply is RF as before and the receiver can keep the
  date and time information .

- Extended Yapp reply is : RT  Receive_TPK
            and is coded : [ACK] [ACK]

If receiver reply is RT the protocol used will be what i have called YappC
for Yapp with checksum. When sender get this packet he MUST use YappC.

Data Packets extension:
-----------------------

If receiver reply is RT the protocol used will be YappC. The checksum allow
detection of packets corrupted along the link, particularly on the RS232
lines where there is no error control or correction (or very poor !)....

Data packets : [STX] [Len] [Datas] [Checksum]

Checksum is the sum of all datas bytes on 8 bits like Xmodem.
If checksum is bad receiver must send a Cancel and go in the CW state.

Transfer Resuming:
------------------

A new field has been added to the resume reply to tell sender if receiver
can use YappC or not.

- Resume reply for Yapp: (as used before by TPK and FBB)

    [NAK] [Len] [R] [NUL] [Received Length] [NUL]
            I    I                I
            I    I                +-- in ASCII as in the header
            I    +-- as Resume !
            I
            +------- len of the following bytes

- Resume reply for YappC:

    [NAK] [Len] [R] [NUL] [Received Length] [NUL] [C] [NUL]
                                                   I
                Tell sender i can go in YappC -----+

    When sender get this packet he must use YappC.
